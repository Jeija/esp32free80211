# IMPORTANT NOTE
*This project is now obsolete, please use [esp32-80211-tx](https://github.com/Jeija/esp32-80211-tx) instead. [esp32-80211-tx](https://github.com/Jeija/esp32-80211-tx) makes use of Espressif's `esp_wifi_80211_tx` API and is compatible with the latest [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) version.*

I'm still keeping this repository up since some niche use cases might not be compatible with the new `esp_wifi_80211_tx` API and because lots of sites link to this page. If you still want to use esp32free80211, please be advised that this project is currently incompatible with the latest version of [esp32-wifi-lib](https://github.com/espressif/esp32-wifi-lib). In order to get this working, you will need to downgrade to an older version, tested with esp32-wifi-lib git commit `ffe5a4c14fe9c933c776fadc62fa9d409929e6f9`.

## Introduction
Even though Espressif open sourced their [IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), the underlying [esp32-wifi-lib](https://github.com/espressif/esp32-wifi-lib) remains closed source and sparsely documented. Since I still wanted to be able to send arbitrary IEEE 802.11 data frames, I took a look at the `ieee80211_freedom_output` function in `ieee80211_output.o` in `libnet80211.a`. By reverse engineering the assembly code I was able to find a workaround / hack that makes it possible to use `ieee80211_freedom_output` and force the ESP32 to send data or management frames with custom data.

This functionality can be useful in various ways, e.g. for mesh networking, [unidirectional long-distance communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBfa4yk5TdU) or low-overhead data transmission. It can, however, be abused for spamming large numbers of invalid SSIDs, jamming WiFi networks or sending deauthentication frames in order to sniff SSIDs of hidden wireless networks. Please be advised that such usage is morally doubtful at best and illegal at worst. Use this at your own risk.

## Project Description
In order to demonstrate the freedom output functionality, this software broadcasts the infamous lines from Rick Astley's `Never gonna give you up`. This is achieved by manually assembling IEEE 802.11 beacon frames in `main.c` and broadcasting them via the hidden `ieee80211_freedom_output` function in espressif's WiFi stack.

If you want to use raw packet sending functionality in your own project, just copy the `components/free80211` component. The only function it exposes is the following:

```C
// buffer: Raw IEEE 802.11 packet to send, will be sent as-is, apart from bytes 24 - 31 which will be set to 0x00 in case buffer[0] is 0x80.
// len: Length of IEEE 802.11 packet. Must be larger than 23 and smaller than or equal 0x578.
int8_t free80211_send(uint8_t *buffer, uint16_t len);
```

### Compile / Flash
This project uses the [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf). With the ESP-IDF installed, execute
```
make menuconfig
```
and configure the SDK to use your preferred settings (baudrate, python2 executable, serial flasher port, â€¦) and proceed to compile and flash this project using
```
make flash
```
